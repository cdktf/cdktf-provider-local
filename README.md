## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform local Provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~> 2.1` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by generating the [provider constructs manually](https://cdk.tf/imports).

These are the upstream dependencies:

- [Terraform CDK](https://cdk.tf)
- [Terraform local Provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-local)
- [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped.
